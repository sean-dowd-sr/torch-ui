# Changelog

All notable changes to `@torch-ui/solid` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-09

### Fixed
- Restored **`MegaMenu`** and **`Breadcrumbs`** behavior from v0.5.15 (`InvertedContext`, `inverted` prop) after an accidental regression in v0.6.0.
- **`DropdownMenu`**, **`ContextMenu`**, and many form/navigation components: repaired truncated Tailwind classes (`data-[disabled]:…`, `disabled:…`) that produced invalid CSS in v0.6.0; restored intended `cursor-not-allowed` and disabled surface styling consistent with v0.5.15.
- **`NumberField`**: stepper triggers no longer used a broken `disabled:disabled:opacity-50` class string; disabled styling matches the standalone input path.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-18

### Added
- `Wizard.Vertical`: new two-column layout component that combines the vertical stepper with a content panel side-by-side. Props: `step`, `stepLabels`, `variant`, `sidebarWidth` (`'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'`), `gap` (`'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'`), `sidebarClass`, `contentClass`, `class`, `children`. Also exported as `VerticalWizard`.

### Fixed
- `theme.css`: added `color-scheme: light` to `:root` and `color-scheme: dark` to `.dark`. Without this, Safari/WebKit on iOS and iPadOS rendered native elements (inputs, selects, scrollbars, focus rings) using the system `prefers-color-scheme` rather than the active `.dark` class, causing those elements to appear inverted relative to the page theme.
- `WizardStepper` (vertical): refactored to a track-column layout (`flex-col items-center`) so the connector line is always pixel-perfect centered under the step circle regardless of variant or label length.

## [0.3.6] - 2026-03-18

### Fixed
- `Carousel`: `setInterval` callback was reading `local.slides` (a prop getter) on every tick, which re-evaluated the prop expression and created JSX outside the reactive tree, causing "computations created outside createRoot or render" warnings. Fixed by wrapping `local.slides` in `createMemo`, so the timer reads a stable cached value instead of re-evaluating JSX on each tick.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-03-17

### Changed
- **All form components** (`Input`, `TextArea`, `Select`, `Autocomplete`, `NumberField`, `DatePicker`, `DateRangePicker`, `MultiSelect`, `RadioGroup`, `Slider`, `Switch`, `TimePicker`, `ColorPicker`, `CodeInput`, `Checkbox`, `FileUpload`): `error` and `helperText` props widened from `string` to `JSX.Element`, allowing rich content like links or formatted text in validation messages and hints.
- `PromptWithAction`: `actionLabel` widened from `string` to `JSX.Element`.
- `AlertDialog`: `description` widened from `string` to `JSX.Element`.
- `EmptyState`: `description` widened from `string` to `JSX.Element`.

### Fixed
- `Checkbox`: label was visually lower than the box due to line-height half-leading. Changed wrapper to `items-center` and removed manual `mt-0.5`/`mt-[3px]` offset on the control. Also changed inner row from `inline-flex` to `flex` to eliminate 2px descender gap when the checkbox is used inside a flex row alongside other controls.
- `RadioGroup`: same alignment fix — items without a `description` now use `items-center`; `mt-0.5` on the radio circle is applied only when a description is present (multi-line layout).
- `Link`: always renders `inline-flex items-center` instead of plain `inline`, fixing vertical misalignment when used as a flex child alongside form controls.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-03-17

### Added
- `Link`: New `iconStart` and `iconEnd` props (`JSX.Element`) for inline icons. When either is set, the link renders as `inline-flex items-center gap-1`.
- `Tag`: New `iconStart` and `iconEnd` props (`JSX.Element`) for inline icons before/after the label.
- `Input`: New `prefix` and `suffix` props for fixed text/content segments separated by a border divider (e.g. `prefix="https://"`, `suffix=".com"`). Unlike `startAdornment`/`endAdornment`, these render outside the text area entirely so typed text can never overflow into them.

### Fixed
- `Input`: When `suffix` or `prefix` is present, the border and focus ring move to the wrapper container so the compound input renders as a single cohesive unit.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-03-15

### Changed
- `CodeBlock`: Removed built-in `prismjs` dependency. Syntax highlighting is now opt-in via a `highlighter` prop — pass any function `(code: string, language: string) => string | Promise<string>` (e.g. Prism, Shiki, highlight.js). Without a highlighter, code renders as plain text. This eliminates the `prismjs` peer dependency and all related CJS/ESM interop issues across bundlers and runtimes.

### Removed
- `prismjs` removed from `peerDependencies`. Consumers handle their own highlighter.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- CSS files now shipped at root-level `styles/` in addition to `dist/styles/` so that `@import '@torch-ui/solid/styles/theme.css'` resolves correctly in `@tailwindcss/vite` and other CSS processors that use physical file paths rather than the `exports` map.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added
- `--surface-stripe` CSS token — programmatically 1.5% darker than `surface-raised`, used for even striped table rows. Fully dynamic: adapts to any `--surface-light` / `--surface-dark` seed.
- `--color-surface-stripe` registered in `@theme` so `bg-surface-stripe` is available as a Tailwind utility.

### Changed
- **Surface elevation ladder refined** — `--surface-light` default updated to `#fdfdfd`; `--surface-raised` derives via `color-mix` from seed (lighter than base in light mode, lighter than base in dark mode).
- **Disabled form inputs** (`Input`, `CodeInput`, `Select`, `NumberField`, `TextArea`) now use `bg-surface-dim` so disabled fields are visibly muted against the page background.
- **Tag** dark-mode variant backgrounds (`success`, `warning`, `danger`, `info`) now use opacity-based tints (e.g. `success-500/20`) for consistency with the `primary` variant.
- **Table** `thead`/`tfoot` use `bg-surface-overlay`; body rows use `bg-surface-raised`; striped even rows use `bg-surface-stripe`; row hover uses `hover:bg-primary-500/20` (works in both light and dark mode).
- **CodeBlock** container background changed to `bg-surface-raised`; collapsible "Show code" trigger uses `bg-surface-overlay` (was transparent when embedded, making it invisible).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-13

### Changed (Breaking)
- **Compound component pattern** for `DropdownMenu`, `ContextMenu`, `Tooltip`, `Popover`, `HoverCard`, `Collapsible`, `MenuBar` (previously `NavigationMenu`), `MegaMenu`, and `Wizard`/`Stepper`. Sub-components are now accessed as properties of the root (e.g. `DropdownMenu.Trigger`, `HoverCard.Content`) instead of separate named exports. Update imports accordingly.
- `HoverCard.Content` `showArrow` now defaults to `true` (was `false`). Pass `showArrow={false}` to opt out.

### Fixed
- Resolved `computations created outside a createRoot or render will never be disposed` SolidJS warning — caused by JSX expressions in module-level data arrays in consumer apps, not by the icon helper.
- Fixed infinite recursion in `Collapsible`, `DropdownMenu`, `ContextMenu`, and `Tooltip` caused by `Object.assign` mutating Kobalte's namespace object — original sub-component references are now captured before reassignment.
- Fixed `MegaMenu` full-width variant opening taller than content then shrinking — removed `height` from viewport CSS transition so height snaps immediately.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- `MegaMenuBarLink` exported from `@torch-ui/solid/navigation` barrel
- `FileUploadLabels` interface and `labels` prop on `FileUpload` — override any of the 27 built-in UI strings (dropzone copy, button text, aria-labels, status text, validation errors, summary messages) for full localisation support; English defaults preserved for backwards compatibility

### Fixed
- Component prop corrections across navigation components
